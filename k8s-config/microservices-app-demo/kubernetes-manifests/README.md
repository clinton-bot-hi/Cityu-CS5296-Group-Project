:warning: **FOR REFERENCE ONLY** Kubernetes manifests provided in this directory are not directly
deployable to a cluster. They are meant to be used with `skaffold` command to
insert the correct `image:` tags.

Use the manifests in [/release](https://github.com/clinton-bot-hi/Cityu_CS5296_Group_Project/tree/main/k8s-config/microservices-app-demo/release) directory which are configured with
pre-built public images.
